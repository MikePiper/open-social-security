SPOUSAL BENEFITS WITH CHILD IN CARE

    SSAct 202(s)(1) and CFR 404.348: Children over 16 and not disabled don't count as children in care for purposes of:
        *Qualifying for spousal benefits under age 62
        *Avoiding reduction for entitlement prior to FRA
        *Qualifying for mother's/father's benefits


    *No reduction for age if there is a child in care entitled on worker's record (i.e., under 16 or disabled)
    *Can receive spousal benefits prior to 62 if there is a child under 16 or disabled
    *When spouse reaches 62 (or 62 and 1 month), it DOES NOT trigger deemed retirement filing. (See https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204035 B2)
    *If younger than FRA when child turns 16, spousal benefit is suspended
        *If spouse is over 62 (or 62 and 1 month) they can file Form SSA-25 electing to continue spousal benefit at reduced rate.
            *If they elect to continue, reduction calculated based on month in which reduced benefit begins (rather than based on original month of entitlement and ARF'd later)
            *If they elect to continue, deemed filing for retirement also occurs at that time. (See https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204035 B2)
        *If spouse is not yet 62 (or 62 and 1 month) when child turns 16, they can file Form SSA-25 electing reduced spousal benefits once they DO reach 62 (or 62 and 1 month)
    *If spouse did not elect via Form SSA-25 to continue receiving spousal benefit, unreduced spousal benefit begins automatically at FRA, I think.
        *They are still entitled; it has just been suspended.
        *Suspension is due to SSAct 202(q)(5)(A)
            ...which says that husband/wife benefits shall never be reduced for age for any month for which there is not a certificate expressly electing reduced benefits.
        *But that would not be an issue once person reaches FRA.

ASSUMPTION MADE REGARDING SPOUSAL BENEFITS WITH CHILD IN CARE
*In presentvalue.service.adjustSpousalBenefitDate() (which sets spousalBenefitDate for each person in the maximize functions) spousalBenefitDate represents the date that their non-child-in-care spousal benefit begins (i.e., date they file SSA-25, if applicable or date they reach FRA).
    *If there is a disabled child, or a child under 16 when otherPerson starts retirementBenefit, we are not letting person.spousalBenefitDate be before their FRA
    *Essentially this is making the assumption that the person doesn't file Form SSA-25. They just let spousal benefit stop when child turns 16 (if they're under FRA) then start again at FRA.
    *Reasoning:
        testing indicates that
            *NOT filing SSA-25 tends to be preferable -- even with regular SSA life expectancies.
            *Difference tends to be on the order of 0.1% of the total PV -- not really a big deal.
            *With SSA life expectancies, 2% discount rate seems to be "breakeven" discount rate -- as good to file SSA-25 as to not file it.
        *Not filing SSA-25 is simpler than filing it.
        *Not filing SSA-25 provides slightly more longevity protection.



REMAINING TO-DO FOR SPOUSAL BENEFITS WITH CHILD IN CARE

*Do a commit (or series of them)

*Going to need additional types of solution object
    *"Child in care spousal benefit is suspended when child reaches 16"
    *"Spousal benefits begin again automatically at your FRA"
    *Original filing doesn't need a new type of solution object (because its message will just be same as for normal spousal filing)
        *But it will be tricky in that it is on a date that doesn't match spousalBenefitDate


*Going to need to work on custom date form to account for child-in-care spousal stuff
    *Need message about "no date input necessary for child in care spousal benefits" (like for child benefits)
    *Will need to rename label for spousalBenefitDate input to make it clear it refers to date for beginning non-child-in-care spousal (say something about form SSA-25?)
    *Will need to rework validation

*In tests:
    *Have to redo all child-benefit-related tests for couple
