SPOUSAL BENEFITS WITH CHILD IN CARE

    SSAct 202(s)(1) and CFR 404.348: Children over 16 and not disabled don't count as children in care for purposes of:
        *Qualifying for spousal benefits under age 62
        *Avoiding reduction for entitlement prior to FRA
        *Qualifying for mother's/father's benefits

    *No reduction for age if there is a child in care entitled on worker's record (i.e., under 16 or disabled)
    *Can receive spousal benefits prior to 62 if there is a child under 16 or disabled
    *A person filing for child-in-care spousal benefits is not deemed to have filed for retirement, regardless of their age. (See https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204035 B2)
        *When last child turns 16 (if none are disabled), if person has already reached FRA, they are converted to a normal spousal benefit and normal deemed filing rules (i.e., depending on their DoB) apply at that time.
        *When last child turns 16 (if none are disabled), if person is younger than FRA, their spousal benefit is suspended until FRA. (Then it automatically begins at FRA and normal deemed filing rules apply at that time.)
            *Alternatively they can file Form SSA-25 (if they are at least 62 or 62+1 month) to continue receiving spousal benefit, which would now be reduced based on month in which reduced benefit begins.
                *Deemed filing for retirement would apply at that time.
    *Conversely, filing for retirement *does* cause a deemed filing for spousal benefits, if eligible for such (unless person has old deemeed filing rules and is filing for retirement after FRA).
        *If person has child-in-care, that spousal benefit would be a child-in-care spousal benefit

    *Suspension discussed above is due to SSAct 202(q)(5)(A)
        ...which says that husband/wife benefits shall never be reduced for age for any month for which there is not a certificate expressly electing reduced benefits.

    *Divorce scenarios: Cannot file for child-in-care spousal benefits as an ex-spouse before age 62. (See CFR 404.331 as compared to 404.330 or SS Act 202(b)(1)(B)(ii).)
        *However, once you are 62 and can file regularly for benefits as an ex-spouse, if you do have child in care who is entitled on ANY record, your spousal benefit will not be reduced for early filing.
            *See POMS RS 01310.001.B1c https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0301310001
            *However, that would result in a deemed filing for retirement benefits.
                *See SSAct 202(r)(2), which says that deemed filing doesn't apply when the spouse is entitled as spouse via 202(b)(1)(B)(ii),
                    which specifically refers to "in the case of a wife" as opposed to "wife or divorced wife."

ASSUMPTION MADE REGARDING SPOUSAL BENEFITS WITH CHILD IN CARE
*In presentvalue.service.adjustSpousalBenefitDate() (which sets spousalBenefitDate for each person in the maximize functions) spousalBenefitDate represents the date that their non-child-in-care spousal benefit begins (i.e., date they file SSA-25, if applicable or date they reach FRA).
    *If there is a disabled child, or a child under 16 when otherPerson starts retirementBenefit, we are not letting person.spousalBenefitDate be before their FRA
    *Essentially this is making the assumption that the person doesn't file Form SSA-25. They just let spousal benefit stop when child turns 16 (if they're under FRA) then start again at FRA.
    *Reasoning:
        testing indicates that
            *NOT filing SSA-25 tends to be preferable -- even with regular SSA life expectancies.
            *Difference tends to be on the order of 0.1% of the total PV -- not really a big deal.
            *With SSA life expectancies, 2% discount rate seems to be "breakeven" discount rate -- as good to file SSA-25 as to not file it.
        *Not filing SSA-25 is simpler than filing it.
        *Not filing SSA-25 provides slightly more longevity protection.



TODO: reflect the fact that child-in-care spousal benefits pre-age-62 cannot happen as an ex-spouse
Ultimately have to:
*Make sure that benefits for pre-62 aren't being included in the PV
    **benefit.servce.calculateMonthlyPaymentsCouple() ?
        Lines 461, 470
*Make sure that benefits for pre-62 aren't being included in the output table
    **Should be covered by change above
*Make sure that there's no pre-62 child-in-care spousal being recommended in the output solutionset list
    **solutionset.service?
*Make sure that 62-to-FRA ex-spouse child in care benefits are not being reduced for age, but do result in a deemed filing for retirement benefits.
    **benefit.service.adjustSpousalBenefitsForAge()
        ***Currently reflects spousal benefits not being reduced for age if there is a disabled child or child under 16
        ***This is correct, as long as either personA or personB has started retirement benefits (i.e., child is entitled to child benefit)
            **And if we aren't giving a spousal benefit to personA anyway if they haven't yet filed for retirement, then we're good to go for divorce scenario.
*Make sure deemed filing is reflected when applicable

*Think through what a person SHOULD be doing in such circumstances, and set everything up accordingly.
    **presentvalue.service.adjustSpousalBenefitDate()
        ***person.spousalBenefitDate currently reflects date on which regular spousal benefit (as opposed to child-in-care spousal benefit) begins.
            **And if there's a child (disabled or under 16), it's currently set to be no earlier than FRA.
        ***Does this require any changes?
            **Before, we were assuming "might as well" get child-in-care spousal benefits, so there was no variable to iterate, since there's no downside (no deemed filing). But now that's not true.
                **But maybe we still don't have to iterate a separate variable here, because it's just the retirementBenefitDate variable?
            **What if a person's own retirementBenefit is before FRA? Then, I think, right now their spousalBenefitDate would be set to FRA. Seems like that's a problem, once we eliminate the automatic child-in-care benefit in this case
    **presentvalue.service.maximizeCouplePViterateOnePerson() ?
    **person.childInCareSpousal ??
**So we're talking about a divorce scenario, which means personB's retirementBenefitDate is fixed.
    We're iterating personA's retirementBenefitDate.
    And we need to reflect that:
        1) child-in-care spousal can't happen before 62 when divorced
        2) once 62 they'd get child-in-care spousal when they file for retirement
        3) and that spousal benefit won't be reduced during time there's a child in care
        4) Basicaly, we need to eliminate the "automatic" child-in-care spousal benefit amount and solutionset object. And then we need to add child-in-care spousal benefit and solutionset object if/when:
            a) there's a childUnder16orDisabled,
            b) personA has reached retirementBenefitDate
        5) Also have to check on suspension/unsuspension of child-in-care
            a) claimingsolution objects,
            b) actual values in calculation
                i) this should already be taken care of. The way it's set up now, in calculateMonthlyPaymentsCouple(), once there is no childUnder16orDisabled, there will be no benefit 


**Current solutionset object allows filing for child-in-care spousal in the past -- way beyond 6 months even (back to date on which personB filed) in married or divorced scenario
**Check every year-by-year benefit in a console log...See what years are being included. Stuff way in the past??
