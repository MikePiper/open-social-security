SPOUSAL BENEFITS WITH CHILD IN CARE

    SSAct 202(s)(1) and CFR 404.348: Children over 16 and not disabled don't count as children in care for purposes of:
        *Qualifying for spousal benefits under age 62
        *Avoiding reduction for entitlement prior to FRA
        *Qualifying for mother's/father's benefits

    *No reduction for age if there is a child in care entitled on worker's record (i.e., under 16 or disabled)
    *Can receive spousal benefits prior to 62 if there is a child under 16 or disabled
    *A person filing for child-in-care spousal benefits is not deemed to have filed for retirement, regardless of their age. (See https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0200204035 B2)
        *When last child turns 16 (if none are disabled), if person has already reached FRA, they are converted to a normal spousal benefit and normal deemed filing rules (i.e., depending on their DoB) apply at that time.
        *When last child turns 16 (if none are disabled), if person is younger than FRA, their spousal benefit is suspended until FRA. (Then it automatically begins at FRA and normal deemed filing rules apply at that time.)
            *Alternatively they can file Form SSA-25 (if they are at least 62 or 62+1 month) to continue receiving spousal benefit, which would now be reduced based on month in which reduced benefit begins.
                *Deemed filing for retirement would apply at that time.
    *Conversely, filing for retirement *does* cause a deemed filing for spousal benefits, if eligible for such (unless person has old deemeed filing rules and is filing for retirement after FRA).
        *If person has child-in-care, that spousal benefit would be a child-in-care spousal benefit

    *Suspension discussed above is due to SSAct 202(q)(5)(A)
        ...which says that husband/wife benefits shall never be reduced for age for any month for which there is not a certificate expressly electing reduced benefits.

ASSUMPTION MADE REGARDING SPOUSAL BENEFITS WITH CHILD IN CARE
*In presentvalue.service.adjustSpousalBenefitDate() (which sets spousalBenefitDate for each person in the maximize functions) spousalBenefitDate represents the date that their non-child-in-care spousal benefit begins (i.e., date they file SSA-25, if applicable or date they reach FRA).
    *If there is a disabled child, or a child under 16 when otherPerson starts retirementBenefit, we are not letting person.spousalBenefitDate be before their FRA
    *Essentially this is making the assumption that the person doesn't file Form SSA-25. They just let spousal benefit stop when child turns 16 (if they're under FRA) then start again at FRA.
    *Reasoning:
        testing indicates that
            *NOT filing SSA-25 tends to be preferable -- even with regular SSA life expectancies.
            *Difference tends to be on the order of 0.1% of the total PV -- not really a big deal.
            *With SSA life expectancies, 2% discount rate seems to be "breakeven" discount rate -- as good to file SSA-25 as to not file it.
        *Not filing SSA-25 is simpler than filing it.
        *Not filing SSA-25 provides slightly more longevity protection.
