      
FAMILY MAX FOR PERSON ON DISABILITY

    https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615742
    family maximum is lesser of:
    85% of the AIME (but not less than the PIA before COLAs), or
    150% of the worker's PIA before COLAs.
    ...then you add all the COLAs back.


COMBINED FAMILY MAXIMUM (CFM)

Rules:
https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615770

    When a child is entitled on two different records, combined family max gets calculated (in year in which simultaneous entitlement first occurs)

    CFM is smaller of:
    1) sum of each worker's regular family max
    2) [ (maximum taxable wages for year in question)/12, treated as an AIME (i.e. plugged into PIA formula) ] x 1.75

    example: child is first entitled on two records in 2018
        128,400 /12 = 10,700.

        .9 (895) + .32 (5397 - 895) + .15 (10700 - 5397) = 3041.59

        3041.59 x 1.75 = 5322, which is maximum possible CFM for 2018
    

APPLICATION OF FAMILY MAXIMUM (INCLUDING COMBINED FAMILY MAX)

Rules and examples:
https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615768

    1) If combined family max situation, calculate CFM. And family max is combined on record of higher earner.

    2) Back out that worker's PIA to get amount left for rest of family.

    3) Divide "amount left for rest of family" by number of other people entitled on that work record.

    4) If any person in family is entitled on their own record in addition to being entitled on record of worker in question:
        4a) Compare their own entitlement amount to their share of "amount left for rest of family"
        4b) Their total benefit is now the greater of the two. But their benefit as spouse/child is now only the amount needed to bring total up to their share of "amount for rest of family"
        4c) So now we calculate a new "amount left for *rest* of family" (i.e., family other than worker and other than this child/spouse). So it's original "amount for rest of family" minus amount that this person is actually getting as child/spouse.
            (In effect, if a child/spouse is getting their own retirement/disability benefit, it leaves more to rest of family, because part of that person's total benefit isn't coming on record of worker.)

    5) For each person, compare amount that they'd get under family max calculation above to the amount they'd get without regard to faxily max (e.g., 50% of worker's PIA). Then they get lesser of the two.

    Example: Worker's PIA is $1,000 with family max of $1,600. Spouse and two children entitled on worker's record.
                $600 available for rest of family. Divided by 3 people gives $200 per person (which does not exceed the $500 they'd each get without family max. So max is indeed relevant.)
                If spouse also has own retirement benefit of $150, now only $50 counts toward family max. So it's $550 now that gets divided between two children.
                    (Assuming here that combined family max isn't relevant -- kids aren't entitled on spouse's record for some reason. If they were, we'd calc combined family max and use that from beginning instead.)
