Benefits are first adjusted for the maximum and then reduced for age.

FAMILY MAX FOR PERSON ON DISABILITY
https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615742
    family maximum is lesser of:
    85% of the AIME (but not less than the PIA before COLAs), or
    150% of the worker's PIA before COLAs.
    ...then you add all the COLAs back.


REDUCING BENEFITS FOR FAMILY MAX (INCLUDING COMBINED FAMILY MAX)
https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615756
https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615768 (combined family max)

1) Find family max
    *If this is a combined family max situation, calculate CFM. And family max is combined on record of higher earner. Proceed as normal from there.
2) Find each person's "original benefit" on work record of person whose family max we're conerned with
    a) For worker him/herself, this is PIA
    b) For everybody else, this is spousal/widow(er)/child benefit, prior to reduction for age, for own retirement/disability benefit, and for GPO
        *Benefit is reduced for age before reduction for GPO, so family max reduction obviously happens before GPO reduction. (CFR 404.408a(d)(3))
    c) "Original benefit" for a widow(er) is not reduced for deceased spouse's early entitlement. (Source: https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615756)
        *DOES include DRCs though. (Source: https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615710)
        *So, after application of family max, survivor benefit (which at that point is original benefit of deceased PIA + DRCs, limited by family max) is then limited to greater of 82.5% of PIA or amount deceased was receiving
            *(https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615756)
            *Note that for RIB LIM, it's supposed to use non-WEP PIA, when that matters.
            *RIB-LIM happens right after reduction for age. So it happens after second time through family max application.
3) Total all "original benefits" and see if total exceeds (family max - worker's PIA)
4) If it does, find percentage that we can pay: (family max - worker's PIA)/total of original benefits. If it doesn't, consider percentage to be 100% rather than > 100%. (That is, don't let anybody's aux benefit exceed "original benefit.")
5) Multiply each person's original benefit by that percentage. We should now be at (rather than in excess of) family max
6) Then, check to see if anybody is getting their own retirement/disability benefit. If so, reduce current aux benefit by that amount (but not below zero). So now each person's aux benefit is "original benefit, multiplied by fraction for FamilyMax as necessary, reduced for entitlement on own work record"
    *Check rules: what if own retirement/disability benefit is greater/less than PIA? Are we reducing by PIA? By greater of PIA or retirement benefit? By retirement benefit?)
    *In our case, this will only be for spouse/widow, as children are assumed not to be working
7) Re-total aux benefits on work record in question. Total will now be below family max if spouse/widow is entitled on own record. Divide extra additional amount (i.e., amount by which family max exceeds current sum of aux benefits) among children.
8) Make sure nobody's benefit exceeds original benefit.
9) Reduce spouse/widow(er) benefit for age, if applicable


CALCULATING COMBINED FAMILY MAXIMUM (CFM)
https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615770

    When a child is entitled on two different records, combined family max gets calculated (in year in which simultaneous entitlement first occurs)

    CFM is smaller of:
    1) sum of each worker's regular family max
    2) [ (maximum taxable wages for year in question)/12, treated as an AIME (i.e. plugged into PIA formula) ] x 1.75

    example: child is first entitled on two records in 2018
        128,400 /12 = 10,700.

        .9 (895) + .32 (5397 - 895) + .15 (10700 - 5397) = 3041.59

        3041.59 x 1.75 = 5322, which is maximum possible CFM for 2018
