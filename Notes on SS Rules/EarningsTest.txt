^ Says child on childhood disability benefit does not have benefit withheld due to earnings test.

What it actually means is that child's benefit as child won't be withheld due to their OWN earnings. Can still be withheld due to parent's earnings.
 See here: https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0302501140 (Social Security Act also pretty clear on this in 203(f)(1).)


Key point in married scenario: A's earnings first reduce A's retirement benefit and B's spousal benefit. *Then* B's earnings reduce B's spousal benefit. See CFR 404.434
    So we first use A's earnings to reduce A's retirement and B's spousal. And we use B's earnings to reduce B's retirement and A's spousal.
    Then if further withholding is necessary we have their own earnings reduce their own spousal.

    Says that if a child of personA is entitled on personB's record, deem child to be entitled on personA's record as well for the sake of withholding due to A's earnings.



Social Security Act 203(f)(1)(F) might be saying that a person entitled to spousal benefits solely due to having child in care doesn't have benefits reduced by earnings test if they are earning less than 1/12 threshold amount per month.
