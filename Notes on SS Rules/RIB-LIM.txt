202(e)(2)(D) is RIB-LIM provision for widows. 202(f)(2)(D) for widowers.

202(k) is simultaneous entitlement to benefits
202(k)(5) is GPO
202(q) is reduction for age
203(a) is family maximum
203(b) is earnings test
215(g) is rounding of benefits to dollar


WE KNOW:
*RIB-LIM reduction happens before reduction due to own entitlement (see SS Act 202(k)(3)(A))
*RIB-LIM happens after reduction for age and family max (see POMS RS 00615.320)
*Reduction for family max happens before reduction for age (see CFR 404.410)
*reduction for age happens before reduction for own entitlement (see CFR 404.407)
    ^^^ Note that this is different in widow(er) scenario than for spousal scenario. See "method b" vs "method c" here: https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0300615020
*reduction for family max happens before reduction for earnings test (see earnings test notes)
*reduction for age happens before earnings test (see RS 02501.095)
*reduction for own entitlement happens before earnings test (see RS 02501.095)
*GPO happens after 202(q) and any reductions in 202 prior to 202(k)(5) -- so after reduction for age and RIB-LIM (see 202(k)(5))
*GPO happens after own entitlement (see CFR 404-408a)



Example possible solutions for order of widow(er) benefit calculation:

family max
age (has to be after family max)
RIB-LIM (has to be after family max and age)
own entitlement (has to be after RIB-LIM, family max, age)
earnings test (has to be after family max, age, own entitlement)
GPO (has to be after RIB-LIM, age, and own entitlement)


family max
age
RIB-LIM
own entitlement
GPO
earnings test
