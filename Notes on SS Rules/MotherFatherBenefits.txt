Eligibility:
    *ChildUnder16orDisabled
    *Not entitled to widow(er) benefits
    *Not entitled to retirement benefit that is as large as mother/father original benefit
    *File for them (or you were entitled to spousal benefits in month before the month in which the spouse died)

Calculation:
    *Original benefit is 75% of deceased spouse PIA
    *Reduced by earnings test? (Yes per RS 00208.025 )
    *Reduced by GPO? (Yes, per CFR 404.408a or RS 00208.025)
    *Reduced by family max? (Yes per RS 00208.015.B2. NOTE: REDUCED EVEN IF DIVORCED -- unlike divorced spouse or divorce widow(er) benefits)
    *Reduced for own entitlement? (Yes, reduced by retirement benefit amount specfically rather than PIA -- like widow(er) benefits. See RS 00208.015)
    *NOT reduced for age (and widow/widower benefit cannot be reduced for age below mother/father benefit amount if there is "child in care")

Per 404.621, retroactivity up to 6 months allowed (but no earlier than date of death). Doesn't matter if mother/father is disabled or not. Doesn't matter if FRA or not.


*CFR 404.335(b) says that:
    *Mother/father benefits automatically convert to widow(er) benefits at FRA. We don't really have to worry about that though, because we'd never have a person filing for widow(er) later than FRA,
        given the option to file at FRA.
    *Not directly mother/father related, but also says that:
        *Deemed filing for widow(er) benefits occurs at death if survivor has reached FRA. Don't have to worry about this, for same reason as above.
        *Deemed filing for widow(er) benefits occurs at death if survivor is under FRA and isn't entitled to retirement or disability benefits. By time survivor is using calculator, this will already have happened.
