find initial set of four testDates
	Set each spouse's retirement test date to later of age 62 month or today.
	Set each spouse's spousal test date to later of age 62 month or today, but no earlier than other spouse's age 62 date.

initialize saved PV as zero

set four saved dates equal to four initial test dates

set ending test date for each spouse equal to month they turn 70

while spouseA retirement testdate <= spouseA endTestDate
	
	reset spouseB test dates to earliest possible

	while spouseB retirement test date <= spouseB endTestDate
	
		calc PV using current set of 4 test dates

		if PV is greater than saved PV, save new PV and all 4 testdates

		find next possible claiming combination for spouseB

			if spouseB has new deemed filing rules, increment both dates by 1
				(no need to check here if spousal is too early, because at start of this loop it was set to earliest possible)
				But if spousal is currently set later than retirement, don't increment spousal

			if spouseB has old deemed filing rules

				if current retirement testdate < FRA, increment both test dates by 1
					(no need to check here if spousal is too early, because at start of this loop it was set to earliest possible)
					But if spousal is currently set later than retirement, don't increment spousal

				if current retirement testdate >= FRA
					increment retirement testdate by 1
					set spousal date to earliest possible restricted application date (later of FRA or other spouse's retirementtestdate)

		After spouse B's retirement testdate has been incremented, adjust spouseA's spousal date as necessary
			
			If spouseA has new deemed filing rules, set spousal testdate to later of spouseA retirement testdate or spouseb retirement testdate
			
			If spouseA has old deemed filing rules

				if spouseA current retirement testdate < FRA, set spouseA spousal testdate to later of spouseA retirement testdate or spouseB retirement testdate

				if spouseA current retirement testdate >= FRA, set spouseA spousal testdate to earliest possible restricted application date (later of FRA or spouse B's retirement testdate)

					
	Add 1 month to spouse A's retirement testdate

after loop is finished, console log saved PV and set of 4 saved dates




somewhere in "find next possible combination" sequence, have to check to see if spousal is a legit possibility, otherwise move to next. (This won't be possible for SpouseA though, because a given spouseA combination has to be run against all possible spouseB combinations...)
	*Does A's spousal date have to get adjusted within the loop adjusting B's dates?
