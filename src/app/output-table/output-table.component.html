        The following table shows what your year-by-year benefit amounts would be <em>if</em> both people are still alive throughout the year in question.
        The survivor benefit amounts at the bottom of the table assume that
        a) the deceased person lived at least until the age at which they planned to file for their retirement benefit and that
        b) the surviving person waits at least until their full retirement age to file for a survivor benefit.

        The following table shows year-by-year benefit amounts. Note that in cases in which one person (and only one person) is using an assumed death age,
        this table shows what the benefit amounts would be if the <em>other</em> person lives at least beyond that point.

    <!-- If neither person is using regular mortality table (i.e., both using assumed death age), table should be pretty self-explanatory. -->
