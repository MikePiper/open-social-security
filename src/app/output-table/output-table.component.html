      The following table shows what your year-by-year benefit amounts would be <em>if</em> both people are still alive throughout the year in question.
      The survivor benefit amounts at the bottom of the table assume that
      a) the deceased person lived at least until the age at which they planned to file for their retirement benefit and that
      b) the surviving person waits at least until their full retirement age to file for a survivor benefit.
