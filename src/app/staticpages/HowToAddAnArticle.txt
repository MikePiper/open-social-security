Create new component for the article in the /staticpages/articles directory:
    ng generate component staticpages/articles/ArticleComponentName
    ^^This creates the component and adds it to the declarations array in app.module.ts

Delete spec and css files for that component. And in the ts file, change it to "styles" rather than styleURL. (Make the array empty, unless it needs its own css for some reason.)

in the .ts file, in constructor set title for page

In app-routing.module.ts, add a path for new component.

Also add it to static.paths.ts

In articles-home-component.html, add link to new article.

Commit

Instead of regular "ng build --prod", run "npm run build:prerender"
    *If you also want to see it locally, run "npm run build:prerender && npm run serve:prerender" then view localhost:8080

Now instead of uploading files to GH, use filezilla to upload everything in dist/browser directory (and nothing else) to a2hosting's public_html directory

maybe no longer necessary: git pull --rebase origin master

Push code to GH

Link to article in roundup.
