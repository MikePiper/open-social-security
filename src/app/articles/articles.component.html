<h1>When Should I File or Social Security</h1>
When you delay Social Security, you are giving up some money today (i.e., this month's benefit) in exchange for a greater stream of income in the future.

Whether or not this is a good idea depends on an assortment of factors.

For a single person, it's primarily a question of:
<ol>
<li>how long you will live, and</li>
<li>what you're giving up by delaying benefits (i.e., what rate of return you miss out on, as a result of having to spend down your portfolio more quickly).</li>
</ol>

The better your health...(also discuss importance of income here)

If interest rates are high...

If interest rates are low...

For a married couple:
<ul>
<li>When the person with the higher earnings record delays claiming benefits, it increases the amount the couple receives as long as <em>either</em> spouse is still alive.</li>
<li>When the person with the lower earnings record delays claiming benefits, it increases the amount the couple receives as long as <em>both</em> people are still alive.</li>
</ul>

In other words, it's usually much more advantageous for the higher earner to delay than for the lower earner.

For an "average" couple (i.e., average life expectancies, no complicating factors), a good rough-draft strategy is for the lower earning spouse to plan to claim as early as possible -- at age 62 or 62 and 1 month -- and for the higher earning spouse to wait all the way until 70.

From there, adjustments can be made based on individual circumstances.

If both spouses are in good health, that's a point in favor of the lower earner waiting somewhat beyond age 62.

If both spouses are in poor health, that's a point in favor of the higher earner filing somewhat before age 70.

Adjust based on interest rates...

Tax planning is very case-by-case, but it's <em>often</em> a point in favor of delaying.

In short, spending down tax-deferred retirement accounts in order to delay benefits has the effect of decreasing the portion of your lifetime income that's made up of tax-deferred distributions and increasing the portion of your lifetime income that's made up of Social Security benefits. In most cases, that's a good tradeoff because Social Security is at least partially nontaxable.

But again, tax planning is case-by-case. Just about anything that appears on your Form 1040 could be an important factor in the analysis. Your state's laws can also play a major role. (For instance, in some states Social Security is completely nontaxable, which naturally plays a big part in the decision.)

To be clear though, there are an assortment of other factors that could play into the decision, which have not been discussed here. Things such as:
A government pension,
A minor child or adult disabled child,
The earnings test (if you'll be working beyond age 62), or
A major difference in ages between you and your spouse.
