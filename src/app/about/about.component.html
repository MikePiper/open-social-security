    <p>Open Social Security is a free, basic, open-source Social Security strategy calculator.</p>
    <p>Please note that Open Social Security does not currently account for all the various circumstances that a real-life person/couple might face. For instance, it does not currently account for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The earnings test (for people who are still working and filing for benefits before full retirement age),</li>
            <li>The government pension offset (GPO),</li>
            <li>Child benefits (or spousal benefits for people younger than age 62 with a child in care),</li>
            <li>Disability benefits,</li>
            <li>Strategies for people who are already widowed (or widowered) when they are using the calculator, or</li>
            <li>The possibility that your life expectancy (or your spouse's life expectancy) may be significantly shorter or longer than average.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>I hope to add functionality to account for such things, but it will take time. In the meantime, to learn more about Social Security, including the above topics, you may want to read my book: <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0997946512/?tag=openss-20/" target="_blank">Social Security Made Simple</a></em>.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you may find one or both of the following (paid) calculators to be helpful. I have no association with either one, but they are each created by respected experts in the field.</p>
