    <p>Open Social Security is a free, basic, open-source Social Security strategy calculator.</p>
    <p>Please note that Open Social Security does not currently account for all the various circumstances that a real-life person/couple might face. For instance, it does not currently account for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The earnings test (for people who are still working and filing for benefits before full retirement age),</li>
            <li>Child benefits (or spousal benefits for people younger than age 62 with a child in care),</li>
            <li>Disability benefits,</li>
            <li>Strategies for people who are already widowed (or widowered) when they are using the calculator, or</li>
            <li>Tax planning reasons or other unrelated reasons why it might be better for you to file earlier or later than the calculator suggests.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>I intend to add functionality to account for some of the above things, but it will take time. In the meantime, to learn more about Social Security, you may want to read my book: <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0997946512/?tag=openss-20/" target="_blank">Social Security Made Simple</a></em>.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you may find one or both of the following (paid) calculators to be helpful. I have no association with either one, but they are each created by respected experts in the field.</p>

    <h2>About the Author (Mike Piper)</h2>
    I am a CPA in St. Louis, Missouri. I'm the author of nine financial books, as well as the popular blog "<a href="https://obliviousinvestor.com/" target="_blank">Oblivious Investor</a>."
    I am an occasional public speaker (usually about Social Security or tax planning), and I have been quoted as a Social Security expert in numerous publications (e.g., Wall Street Journal, AARP, Kiplinger, and several others).
    <h2>How does the calculator work?</h2>
    For people <em>really</em> interested in the details of how this calculator works, I'd encourage you to check out the source code, available at the following link. (The README file is a good place to start.)

    <p>For those just seeking a summary version, let's consider the simplest example: an unmarried person, using the calculator prior to age 62. For such a person, the calculator:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First assumes they file as early as possible, at 62.</li>
            <li>Calculates the amount of their monthly retirement benefit under such assumption.</li>
            <li>For each year up to age 115, the calculator multiplies the annual retirement benefit by the user's probability of being alive in such year, to arrive at a probability-weighted annual benefit.</li>
            <li>That probability-weighted benefit is then discounted back to age-62 value using the discount rate the user provided as input (i.e., to account for the fact that a dollar today can be invested and is therefore worth more than even an inflation-adjusted dollar in the future).</li>
            <li>All of those probability-weighted, discounted benefit amounts are summed, to arrive at a total "present value" for the assumed claiming strategy (e.g., claiming ASAP at 62).</li>
            <li>The above process is repeated for each possible claiming age (i.e., every month between 62 and 70).</li>
            <li>The claiming age that had the highest present value is then suggested to the user, and the present value associated with such claiming age is provided as well.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>If the person is older than 62 when using the calculator, claiming strategies that are no longer possible (i.e., filing in the past) are eliminated from the analysis.</p>
    <p>For a married couple, it's the same sort of process, but with more going on. Specifically:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>In addition to retirement benefits, spousal benefits and survivor benefits are included in the analysis.</li>
            <li>Probability weighting the various benefits each period involves separate calculations for "probability only Spouse A is alive", "probability only Spouse B is alive", and "probability both spouses are still alive."</li>
            <li>Each combination of possible claiming ages must be considered, for both spouses, and for both types of benefits (i.e., retirement and spousal).</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>What about inflation?</h2>
    <p>Everything is done in "real" (i.e., inflation-adjusted) dollars. So there is no need for you to make manual inflation adjustments.</p>
    <h2><a name="mortality"></a>Mortality Table Options</h2>
        <p>By default, all of the math is done using the SSA's period life table to calculate a person's probability of being alive at a given age. This is roughly appropriate for a person with an average life expectancy</p>
        <p>You also have a few other options though, which come from the Society of Actuaries' <a href="https://www.soa.org/experience-studies/2015/2017-cso-tables/" target="_blank">Commissioner Standard Ordinary (CSO) Tables</a>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2017 CSO Non-smoker Super-preferred (for people in much better than average health)</li>
            <li>2017 CSO Non-smoker Preferred (for people in better than average health)</li>
            <li>2017 CSO Smoker Preferred (for tobacco users in better health than the average tobacco user)</li>
            <li>2017 CSO Smoker Residual Standard (for other tobacco users)</li>
        </ul>
