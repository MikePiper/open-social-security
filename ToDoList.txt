To Do List

As of 4/19/18 this is a fully functional version that takes in birthdate, PIA, gender, and discount rate and outputs the ideal claiming age for a single person.
Also can calculate PV for claiming at an age of user's choice.



Current list of simplifications:
*Currently ignores the "must be 62 for entire month" rule with regard to a person claiming as early as possible.
*Currently for purpose of discounting, all benefits are assumed to be received mid-year rather than discounted monthly.
*If user is already over age 62, probability of being alive should use current age as denominator rather than age 62.
*Currently uses SSA 2014 period life table, which understates life expectancy relative to cohort table. Also doesn't allow for input regarding health status.



Make output somewhere other than in console.

For all of the following, will be assuming that new deemed filing rules apply to everybody, even if they were 62 or older as of 1/1/2016.

Add functionality to only allow spousal benefit if the other spouse is indeed receiving a retirement benefit.
    (Or does this actually go in the combined PV calculation? i.e., start spousal benefit on date that other person starts retirement benefit)

Add functionality to calculate total benefit when person has spousal benefit + retirement benefit.

Add functionality to find total NPV (for both people) when user inputs claiming ages for each spouse. (be sure to note that low-PIA spouse's monthly benefit likely changes when high-PIA spouse files)

Add functionality to find best combination of claiming ages (ignoring survivor benefits)
---------

Create function to calculate a survivor benefit.

Incorporate survivor benefit into total NPV function.

Create function that runs prior function (NPV calculation) for every possible combination of claiming ages
